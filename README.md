# MissionFiveM-Lua
This is the task that I made to apply for a FiveM dev team. It is a client-only task that get's player when he accept's mission, which is to kill N enemies in order to get prize-item.
The enemies are visible on mini map, they have rule to be on level less or equal to 5. Each death of ped is conducted with significant ammount of money that the player can get from them.
The ped's are erased from map after 5 sec from their death. Usually their behavior is agressive but when their HP is less than 60%, they start to hiding in order to heal themselves.
The Interactive Ped who gives you a task is active only till you accept the mission, after that he becomes non-interactable.
